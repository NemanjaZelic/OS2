# OS2
OS2 is an extension to an existing x86-based operating system that implements a simplified RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) distribution system. It is designed for educational and experimental purposes, helping developers understand low-level disk I/O, redundancy, and fault tolerance.


- Implements basic RAID levels (RAID 0 / RAID 1 /RAID 01 / RAID 4/ RAID 5/ RAID6)
- Interfaces with the existing x86 OS disk subsystem
- Provides redundancy or performance improvements (depending on mode)
- Simulates disk failures and recovery for testing fault tolerance
